  * Standards-Version 3.9.3, no change required.
  * Make sure we get the split gcc-mingw-w64 packages (to avoid

  * Enable secure API (required in particular for newer versions of Wine
    Gecko).
  * Allow bootstrapping again (thanks to Sam Morris for pointing out
    that bootstrapping the mingw-w64 package set no longer worked!).
